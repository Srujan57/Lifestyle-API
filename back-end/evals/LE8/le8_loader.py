"""
Load individual functions out of app.py without importing app.py.

WHY THIS EXISTS: app.py cannot be imported in this environment. Two
independent reasons, both pre-existing and unrelated to these tests:

  1. Import chain — app.py pulls in flask, openai, chromadb, pandas, pymongo
     and executes module-level setup (env-var checks, CSV/Chroma loading) at
     import time. Importing it to unit-test five pure functions would mean
     standing up the whole app.

  2. Syntax — the shared venv is Python 3.9.6, and app.py uses 3.10+ union
     annotations (`str | None` at app.py:1830, `bool | None` at app.py:1842).
     A plain import fails at parse time regardless of the dependencies.

So instead of importing, we parse app.py's source with `ast`, pull out just
the FunctionDef nodes we need, and exec them in an isolated namespace. The
`from __future__ import annotations` prefix (PEP 563, available since 3.7)
makes the 3.10-only annotations lazy strings so they never get evaluated,
which is what lets 3.9 run them.

This tests the REAL source text of those functions — not a copy. If someone
edits a threshold in app.py, these tests see the edit on the next run.

def load_functions(*names):
    """
    Extract the named top-level functions AND module-level assignments from
    app.py and return them in a dict. Raises LookupError if any requested name
    is missing, so a renamed or deleted function fails loudly here instead of
    silently skipping tests.

    Assignments are supported because some functions depend on module-level
    constants compiled at import time — _detect_diabetes_status reads
    _DIABETES_NEGATIVE_RE / _DIABETES_INTERROGATIVE_RE / _DIABETES_POSITIVE_RE,
    none of which are FunctionDefs. Requesting them by name here pulls the real
    compiled pattern rather than a copy re-typed into the test file, which is
    the whole point of loading from source.

    Definitions are emitted in the order they appear in app.py, not the order
    requested, so a constant always precedes the function that closes over it.
